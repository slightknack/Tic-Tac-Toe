It seems to me that writing a functioning tic-tac-toe game is the new interview *fizzbuzz*.
This package contains an beautiful tic-tac-toe implementation written in a mere half an hour.
If you're interviewing me and ask me to implement yet another tic-tac-toe game,
I'll refer you to this repo and begin looking for companies who actually want good software engineers (jk ðŸ˜‰).

## Installation
You'll need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your system.
Then, compiling and running `tictactoe` is as simple as:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/slightknack/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
$ cd Tic-Tac-Toe
$ cargo run --release
```

Why run in release mode, you ask? Why not, I respond.

## Challenges
Given that I only spent half an hour on this, It's ~~pretty barebones~~ follows a minimalist design ideology.
Out of the box, Tic Tac Toe supports play between two human players.
Tic Tac Toe is architected for easy extension. 
If you'd like, try implementing your own AI using the `Agent` trait.
