It seems to me that writing a functioning tic-tac-toe game is the new *fizzbuzz* interview question.
This package contains an beautiful tic-tac-toe implementation written in about half an hour.
If you're interviewing me and ask me to implement another tic-tac-toe game,
I'll refer you to this and begin looking for companies who actually want good software engineers (jk ðŸ˜‰).

## Installation
You'll need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your system.
Then, compiling and running `tictactoe` is as simple as:

```
$ git clone 
```
